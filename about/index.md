I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in [Stadius center for dynamical systems, signal processing & data analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) at KU Leuven, advised by Professor [Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?id=16). 

I conduct research on basic machine learning at the intersection of kernel methods, deep learning and dynamical systems. My Ph.D. is generously funded by European Research Council and falls within the scope of [E-DUALITY](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/E/) project.

This blog mostly contains research notes made during my Ph.D. journey. High-level ideas, facts, summaries, mind-maps and musings will populate this blog.

“[Wisdom] is earned through disgrace, through painful realization of the inadequacy of your personal world view.” — [Nat Hillard](https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&d=stanford20080118-01.2.19#)

“In my psychedelic, hazy-vision state, where I reach the ultimate heightened awareness of the beer-buzz, I realise the true meaning of exams: that professors are evil, torture-loving beings, and that we cannot blame them for their shortcomings.” — [Rob Chung](https://web.archive.org/web/20050311153207/http://the-underground.ca/original_website/issues/22/12/life3.html)

“We need a more lasting form of negative feedback than just paper rejections.” — [Jonathan Hardwick](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jonathanh/) on research

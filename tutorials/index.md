# Tutorials

This is a page that I will hopefully keep up to date with a list of tutorials from around the web that are useful on different topics. Wikipedia is often the first search engine result for any new topic, but it rarely provides a didactic explanation on the topic. Tutorials and lectures written by people for the sake of teaching the material are usually far more useful. Hopefully, these will provide that.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
>[__Jon Shlens' Tutorial__](../pdfs/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Provides an intuitive and formal introduction to PCA.

### Lagrange Multipliers
> [__Lagrange Multiplers without Permanent Scarring__](../pdfs/lagrange-multipliers.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Dan Klein's basic introduction/intuitions for Lagrange Multipliers.

### Conjugate Gradients
> [__An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain__](../pdfs/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Jonathan Schewchuk's tutorial that explains "the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations" with "sixty-six illustrations". Humorous throughout :)

### Measure Theory
> [__Measure Theory for Dummies__](../pdfs/UWEETR-2006-0008.pdf){:target="_blank"}: There are a number of great texts that do measure theory justice. This is not one of them. Rather this is a hack way to get the basic ideas down so you can read through research papers and follow whatâ€™s going on.
